Great software! It does what I need, and it is easy to use.
The devs have managed to make lots of features
accessible from a simple to use interface.
One thing I look at with FOSS is how
long the project has been active.
Epesi has been actively developed for a long time.
The devs are in it for the long haul.
Epesi is rock solid, and so are the people behind it!
